# SWOT Examples

## Example 1: Startup Competitive Position

**Subject**: SaaS startup (project management tool for remote teams)
**Objective**: Determine competitive strategy against established players

### SWOT Matrix

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES** |
| | • Built for remote-first (not adapted) | • Small team (8 people) |
| | • Modern async features | • Limited brand awareness |
| | • No legacy technical debt | • Narrow feature set |
| | • Fast iteration speed | • Small customer base for case studies |
| **External** | **OPPORTUNITIES** | **THREATS** |
| | • Remote work growing post-pandemic | • Enterprise tools adding remote features |
| | • Dissatisfaction with bloated tools | • VC-funded competitors with more runway |
| | • Integration ecosystem expanding | • Economic downturn reducing software budgets |
| | • Niche verticals underserved | • Big players could acquire or copy us |

### Strategic Combinations

| Combination | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| **S-O** | Use async-native features to target remote-first companies underserved by adapted enterprise tools |
| **W-O** | Partner with remote work consultants to build credibility without marketing budget |
| **S-T** | Use iteration speed to stay ahead of enterprise features; they're slower to ship |
| **W-T** | Focus on niche vertical to avoid direct competition; be the best for [specific industry] |

### Key Insights
1. Competitive advantage is being remote-native, not remote-adapted—double down on this positioning
2. Direct competition with established players is unwinnable; need niche strategy
3. Speed is the primary advantage; must protect it as team grows

### Recommended Actions
1. Pick one underserved vertical and become synonymous with remote PM for that industry
2. Build case studies through discounted pilots, not paid marketing
3. Ship one async feature per month that enterprise tools don't have

## Example 2: Career Decision

**Subject**: My career as a senior software engineer (8 years experience)
**Objective**: Decide between staying IC, moving to management, or starting a company

### SWOT Matrix

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES** |
| | • Strong technical depth in distributed systems | • Avoid confrontation; hard to give feedback |
| | • Shipped successful products end-to-end | • No management experience |
| | • Good at mentoring junior devs | • Risk-averse financially |
| | • Well-networked in startup ecosystem | • Tendency to over-engineer |
| **External** | **OPPORTUNITIES** | **THREATS** |
| | • Manager shortage in market | • Age discrimination concerns in 5-10 years |
| | • Distributed systems expertise in demand | • AI coding tools changing IC value prop |
| | • Could co-found with trusted former colleagues | • Current company may not have IC growth path |
| | • Remote work opens more options | • Management peers will out-earn IC peers |

### Strategic Combinations

| Combination | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| **S-O** | Technical expertise + manager shortage = tech lead manager role (leverage both) |
| **W-O** | Co-founding with trusted colleague offsets risk-aversion; they handle business |
| **S-T** | Deep expertise protects against AI tools better than general IC work |
| **W-T** | Staying IC without addressing feedback skills limits future options |

### Key Insights
1. The management shortage is real—could enter at tech lead level without starting from scratch
2. "Avoid confrontation" weakness will limit all paths; address directly
3. Financial risk-aversion makes startup path unlikely without significant savings

### Recommended Actions
1. Take a management training course or work with a coach on feedback skills
2. Discuss IC ladder with current company—is Staff Engineer possible?
3. Try tech lead role before committing to full management (reversible experiment)

## Example 3: Product Launch

**Subject**: New mobile app for meal planning
**Objective**: Assess readiness for public launch

### SWOT Matrix

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES** |
| | • Unique recipe recommendation algorithm | • iOS only (no Android) |
| | • Beautiful design; users love it | • No integrations with grocery stores |
| | • Founder has nutrition expertise | • No marketing team or budget |
| | • Active beta user community (500 users) | • Limited recipes (2,000 vs competitor 50,000) |
| **External** | **OPPORTUNITIES** | **THREATS** |
| | • Health trends growing | • Established competitors (Mealime, Paprika) |
| | • Grocery delivery APIs available | • App Store discovery is hard |
| | • Food influencers looking for partnerships | • Users expect free apps with ads |
| | • Corporate wellness programs | • Recipe copyright concerns |

### Strategic Combinations

| Combination | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| **S-O** | Partner with food influencers who can provide reach and recipes |
| **W-O** | Grocery integration is MVP for competitive parity; prioritize before launch |
| **S-T** | Use recommendation quality as differentiator; competitors have volume, we have precision |
| **W-T** | Limited recipes + paid model = very narrow market; need to expand content before launch |

### Key Insights
1. Not ready for public launch—recipe library too small for paid product
2. The recommendation algorithm is differentiator; needs more recipes to shine
3. Grocery integration is table stakes, not a differentiator

### Recommended Actions
1. Delay public launch by 2 months
2. Partner with 5 food bloggers for recipe content (cross-promo deal)
3. Integrate one grocery delivery API (Instacart) as MVP
4. Launch with "founding member" pricing to beta community first

## Example 4: Market Expansion

**Subject**: B2B software company (US-based)
**Objective**: Evaluate European market expansion

### SWOT Matrix

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES** |
| | • Product works; proven in US | • No European staff or entity |
| | • Profitable; self-funded expansion | • English-only product and support |
| | • Some European customers already (10%) | • No GDPR-compliant hosting yet |
| | • Remote-first team can work any timezone | • Pricing in USD only |
| **External** | **OPPORTUNITIES** | **THREATS** |
| | • Less competition in EU for our category | • GDPR compliance is complex |
| | • EU customers willing to pay more | • Brexit complications |
| | • Government contracts possible | • Localization expectations higher in EU |
| | • Strong reseller channel exists | • Economic uncertainty in EU |

### Strategic Combinations

| Combination | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| **S-O** | Use existing EU customers as references; they prove product-market fit |
| **W-O** | Partner with EU reseller rather than building team; they handle localization |
| **S-T** | Profitability means we can invest in GDPR compliance properly |
| **W-T** | English-only + EU expectations = start with UK/Ireland/Netherlands (English-speaking) |

### Key Insights
1. GDPR compliance is non-negotiable prerequisite—this is blocking
2. Reseller model reduces risk and investment required
3. Should focus on English-speaking EU markets first

### Recommended Actions
1. Complete GDPR compliance project (data residency, DPA, privacy controls)
2. Add EUR pricing and EU payment methods
3. Identify 2-3 reseller candidates in UK and Netherlands
4. Don't hire EU staff until reseller model is validated

## Common SWOT Mistakes

**Listing features, not benefits**
- Bad: "We have a mobile app"
- Better: "Mobile app enables on-the-go access competitors lack"

**Confusing internal and external**
- "Bad economy" is a Threat, not a Weakness
- "Poor sales skills" is a Weakness, not a Threat

**Too vague**
- Bad: "Strong brand"
- Better: "70% brand recognition in target demographic"

**Ignoring combinations**
- The matrix is just data collection; the value is in the strategic combinations

**Analysis paralysis**
- SWOT should inform action, not delay it
