## Rule Reference

1. **Form the possessive singular by adding 's** — Charles's friend, Burns's poems, the witch's malice. Exceptions: ancient proper names ending in -es or -is (Jesus', Moses'), and common idioms (for conscience' sake).

2. **In a series of three or more, use a comma after each term except the last** — red, white, and blue. The serial comma prevents ambiguity.

3. **Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas** — "The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot." If the interruption is slight, commas may be omitted.

4. **Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause** — "The early records are obscure, but they suggest..." This rule applies when both clauses are independent (could stand alone).

5. **Do not join independent clauses with a comma** — This error is the "comma splice." Wrong: "It is cold, we should go inside." Right: "It is cold; we should go inside" or "It is cold. We should go inside."

6. **Do not break sentences in two** — Avoid sentence fragments. "I met them on a Cunard liner many years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York." The second part should not stand alone.

7. **Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list, appositive, amplification, or illustrative quotation** — "The situation is perilous: our enemies are many, our supplies few."

8. **Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or to announce a long appositive or summary** — "His first thought on getting out of bed—if he had any thought at all—was to get back in again." Use sparingly; frequent dashes give writing a breathless quality.

9. **The subject and verb must agree in number** — "The bittersweet flavor of youth—its trials, its joys, its adventures, its challenges—are not soon forgotten" is wrong; use "is."

10. **Use the proper case of pronoun** — "between you and I" is wrong; use "between you and me." In compound constructions, test each pronoun alone.

11. **A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject** — "Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful" is wrong (trees weren't walking). Fix: "Walking down the street, I noticed the beautiful trees."

## Guidelines

- Not all comma usage is covered by these rules—focus on the specific patterns described
- Rule 2 (serial comma) is a style choice in some guides; Strunk & White advocate for it
- Some fragments are intentional for effect in creative writing
- Technical writing may have different conventions for colons and lists
