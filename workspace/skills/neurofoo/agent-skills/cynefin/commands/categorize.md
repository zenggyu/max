# Categorize Problem Domain

Quickly determine which Cynefin domain a problem belongs to and what that means for how to approach it.

## Instructions

Assess the characteristics of the problem to determine its domain, then provide the corresponding approach.

### Output Format

**Problem**: [What we're categorizing]

## Quick Domain Test

| Question | Answer | Points To |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Is the right answer obvious or well-documented? | [Yes/No] | Simple if Yes |
| Would an expert know what to do after analysis? | [Yes/No] | Complicated if Yes |
| Can we only understand cause→effect in hindsight? | [Yes/No] | Complex if Yes |
| Is the situation unstable and urgent? | [Yes/No] | Chaotic if Yes |
| Are we genuinely unsure what kind of problem this is? | [Yes/No] | Confused if Yes |

## Classification

**Domain**: [Simple / Complicated / Complex / Chaotic / Confused]

**Confidence**: [High / Medium / Low]

## What This Means

### Response Approach

| Domain | Your Approach |
|--------|---------------|
| **Simple** | Sense → Categorize → Respond (use best practice) |
| **Complicated** | Sense → Analyze → Respond (consult experts) |
| **Complex** | Probe → Sense → Respond (run experiments) |
| **Chaotic** | Act → Sense → Respond (stabilize first) |
| **Confused** | Break down into sub-problems, categorize each |

## Domain Indicators

**Simple/Obvious**
- Everyone agrees on the answer
- There's a standard process
- "We've done this before"

**Complicated**
- Experts can figure it out
- Analysis leads to answers
- Multiple good solutions exist

**Complex**
- Cause and effect unclear in advance
- Patterns emerge over time
- "It depends" is the honest answer

**Chaotic**
- High turbulence, no clear patterns
- Need to act immediately to stabilize
- No time for analysis

**Confused**
- We don't know which domain applies
- Need to break it down first
