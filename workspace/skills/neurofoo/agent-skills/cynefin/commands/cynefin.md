# Cynefin Analysis

Analyze a situation through the Cynefin framework to understand what type of problem it is and choose the appropriate response.

## Instructions

Determine which Cynefin domain the problem belongs to, then apply the appropriate response approach. Be willing to recognize that parts of a problem may span multiple domains.

### Output Format

**Situation**: [What we're analyzing]

---

## Initial Assessment

**What kind of problem is this?**

### Characteristics Check

| Characteristic | Yes/No/Maybe | Evidence |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Cause and effect are clear and predictable | | |
| Experts can analyze and determine the answer | | |
| Outcomes can only be understood in hindsight | | |
| The situation is unstable/in crisis | | |
| We genuinely don't know what kind of problem this is | | |

## Domain Classification

**Primary Domain**: [Simple/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic/Confused]

**Why this domain?**
[Reasoning for the classification]

**Is this a pure domain or does it span multiple?**
[Assessment of whether different aspects belong to different domains]

## Domain-Appropriate Response

### If SIMPLE/OBVIOUS
*Sense → Categorize → Respond*

**Best Practice to Apply**:
[The established, proven approach]

**Implementation**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Risk**: Don't overcomplicate this. Don't call in experts for simple problems.

---

### If COMPLICATED
*Sense → Analyze → Respond*

**Experts Needed**:
[Who has the expertise to analyze this?]

**Analysis Required**:
[What do we need to investigate?]

**Good Practice Options**:
| Option | Expert View | Trade-offs |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| [option] | [analysis] | [trade-offs] |

**Risk**: Multiple right answers exist. Analysis paralysis is possible.

---

### If COMPLEX
*Probe → Sense → Respond*

**Safe-to-Fail Experiments**:
| Probe | What We'd Learn | Amplify if... | Dampen if... |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| [experiment] | [insight] | [success indicators] | [failure indicators] |

**Emergence**: What patterns might emerge? We don't know yet—that's the point.

**Key Mindset**: Don't try to predict. Try things, observe, adapt.

**Risk**: Temptation to analyze instead of probe. "We need more data" delays action.

---

### If CHAOTIC
*Act → Sense → Respond*

**Immediate Stabilization**:
[What action do we take right now to stabilize?]

**Novel Practice**:
[What approach might work? This is invention, not best practice]

**Move to Complex**:
Once stabilized, this should become complex, not return to chaotic.

**Risk**: Don't try to analyze during chaos. Act first.

---

### If CONFUSED
*Break down, then categorize*

**How to break this down**:
| Sub-problem | Likely Domain | Why |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| [sub-problem 1] | [domain] | [reasoning] |
| [sub-problem 2] | [domain] | [reasoning] |

**First step**: [How to get out of confusion]

---

## Boundary Warnings

**Are we in danger of slipping between domains?**

| Transition | Warning Signs | What to Do |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| Simple → Chaotic | Complacency, "we've always done it this way" | Challenge assumptions |
| Complicated → Complex | Analysis isn't converging; experts disagree | Try probes instead |
| Complex → Chaotic | Loss of control; things are degrading | Stabilize fast |

---

## Recommended Approach

**Given this is a [DOMAIN] problem, we should:**

1. [Primary approach]
2. [Supporting action]
3. [Monitoring for domain shift]

**What NOT to do**:
[Approaches that would be wrong for this domain]

## Guidelines

- Most people default to Complicated (analysis) when Complex (probes) is needed
- "Best practice" is only valid in Simple domain
- In Complex, you can't predict—you can only experiment and adapt
- In Chaotic, act first, think later
- Confusion is normal—break the problem down
