# Cynefin Domains Deep Dive

## Simple/Obvious Domain

**Characteristics**
- Cause and effect are clear to everyone
- Obvious relationship between action and outcome
- Standard procedures exist and work
- "The way we've always done it" is valid

**Response Pattern**
```
SENSE → CATEGORIZE → RESPOND
```
1. See what you have
2. Identify which category it falls into
3. Apply the appropriate best practice

**Leadership Style**: Ensure processes are followed, delegate

**Examples**
- Following a recipe
- Processing a standard order
- Onboarding checklist items
- Basic customer service queries

**Danger**
- **Complacency cliff**: Slide into chaos if the domain shifts and you don't notice
- Don't send experts to solve simple problems (waste)
- Don't try to innovate in the simple domain (unnecessary)

---

## Complicated Domain

**Characteristics**
- Cause and effect require analysis to see
- Multiple right answers exist
- Expert knowledge is required
- "Good practice" (not "best practice")

**Response Pattern**
```
SENSE → ANALYZE → RESPOND
```
1. Assess the situation
2. Engage experts to analyze options
3. Choose an approach from the good options

**Leadership Style**: Consult experts, don't micromanage technical work

**Examples**
- Engineering a bridge
- Diagnosing a medical condition
- Optimizing a database
- Tax planning

**Danger**
- **Analysis paralysis**: Analyzing forever instead of deciding
- Experts may disagree—multiple good answers exist
- Don't mistake for Complex (analysis won't help there)

---

## Complex Domain

**Characteristics**
- Cause and effect only visible in hindsight
- Patterns emerge, they can't be predicted
- Novel practices emerge through experimentation
- "Safe-to-fail" experiments are the right approach

**Response Pattern**
```
PROBE → SENSE → RESPOND
```
1. Run safe-to-fail experiments
2. Observe what patterns emerge
3. Amplify what works, dampen what doesn't

**Leadership Style**: Create conditions for emergence, don't command

**Examples**
- Raising a child
- Building a new market
- Organizational culture change
- Navigating a relationship
- Innovation/R&D

**Danger**
- **Temptation to analyze**: Want to turn it into Complicated, but it's not
- **Prediction fallacy**: You cannot predict complex systems
- **Expert overconfidence**: Experts may insist they know the answer

**Key Mindset Shifts**
- From "plan then execute" to "experiment and adapt"
- From "find the answer" to "discover emerging patterns"
- From "prevent failure" to "fail safe and learn"

---

## Chaotic Domain

**Characteristics**
- No perceivable cause and effect
- High turbulence, no patterns
- Need for immediate action to stabilize
- Novel practices invented in the moment

**Response Pattern**
```
ACT → SENSE → RESPOND
```
1. Take action to stabilize (any action)
2. Observe what happens
3. Respond to move toward complex or complicated

**Leadership Style**: Command and control (temporarily), decisive action

**Examples**
- Building on fire
- System is down, customers are screaming
- Organizational crisis
- Market crash

**Danger**
- **Paralysis**: The instinct to analyze when action is needed
- **Staying too long**: Chaotic should be temporary—get to Complex
- **Creating chaos**: Some leaders are comfortable here and create it

**Key Actions**
- Stop the bleeding first
- Any stabilizing action is better than analysis
- Establish order, then figure out what happened

---

## Confused Domain

**Characteristics**
- Don't know which domain applies
- Multiple domains may be present
- Clarity requires decomposition

**Response Pattern**
```
BREAK DOWN → CATEGORIZE → APPLY DOMAIN-APPROPRIATE RESPONSE
```
1. Split the problem into component parts
2. Categorize each part
3. Address each in its own domain

**Examples**
- "We need to improve our business" (too vague)
- New, unfamiliar territory
- Cross-functional issues spanning many domains

**Danger**
- **Forcing a domain**: Treating everything as Complicated because it feels safe
- **Applying single approach**: One-size-fits-all doesn't work

## Domain Dynamics

### Boundary Between Simple and Chaotic
The "cliff" between Simple and Chaotic is dangerous. If you're complacent in Simple ("we've always done it this way"), a disruption can push you directly into Chaos.

### Complicated vs Complex
The most common mistake: treating Complex as Complicated.

| Complicated | Complex |
|-------------|---------|
| Experts have answers | No one has answers yet |
| Analysis converges | Analysis doesn't help |
| Knowable with effort | Unknowable in advance |
| Good practice applies | Need to discover what works |

### Moving Through Domains
- **Chaotic → Complex**: After stabilizing, you move to experimentation
- **Complex → Complicated**: As patterns emerge and become understood
- **Complicated → Simple**: When we codify expert knowledge into procedure

## Appropriate Leadership by Domain

| Domain | Decision Making | Style |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Simple | Follow the rules | Sense-and-respond; delegate |
| Complicated | Consult then decide | Expert-advisory |
| Complex | Create conditions | Facilitative; emergent |
| Chaotic | Decide immediately | Command-and-control |
| Confused | Seek clarity first | Inquiry-based |
