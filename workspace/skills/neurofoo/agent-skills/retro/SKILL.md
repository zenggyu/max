# Start-Stop-Continue Retrospective

Run a focused retrospective identifying what to Start, Stop, and Continue.

## Instructions

### Output Format

**Subject**: What period or topic are we reflecting on?
**Timeframe**: What period does this cover?

**Top Priority**
The single most impactful change from this retro:
> [Action] — because [reason]

**Check-in**
When will we review if these changes are working?
> [Date or trigger]

## Guidelines

- Be specific: "Start daily standups" not "communicate more"
- Be behavioral: Focus on actions, not attitudes
- Balance: Aim for 3-5 items per category
- Celebrate Continues: Don't skip this section—recognize what's working
- Assign owners: Unowned actions don't happen
- One priority: If everything is important, nothing is
