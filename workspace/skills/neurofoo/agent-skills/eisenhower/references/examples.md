### Q3: DELEGATE (Urgent + Not Important)

| Task | Why Urgent? | Who Can Handle? | Delegation Plan |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Update product demo | Sales meeting tomorrow | Solution Engineer | Share notes, they know product |
| Collect user feedback summary | Exec asked for it | UX Researcher | They have raw data |
| Fix typo in help docs | User complained | Support team | They have edit access |

### Q4: ELIMINATE (Not Urgent + Not Important)

| Task | Why Are You Doing This? | Elimination Strategy |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Attending all standups | "Staying informed" | Read async updates instead |
| Reading all Slack channels | FOMO | Unsubscribe from low-signal channels |
| Reformatting spreadsheets | Procrastination | Ship ugly; no one cares |

**Time Distribution**

| Quadrant | % of Time | Ideal % | Gap |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----|
| Q1: Do | 50% | 20-25% | -25% too much |
| Q2: Schedule | 20% | 60-70% | +40% needed |
| Q3: Delegate | 20% | 10-15% | -5% to delegate |
| Q4: Eliminate | 10% | <5% | -5% to cut |

**Insight**: Currently reactive (Q1 heavy). Need to delegate more and protect Q2 time.

## Common Mistakes

**Everything in Q1**
If everything is urgent, nothing is. Ask: "What actually happens if this waits?"

**Empty Q2**
If you never schedule important-but-not-urgent work, you'll always be in Q1. Q2 is where you prevent future crises.

**Can't delegate (Q3)**
"No one can do it as well as me" = bottleneck. Train people or lower standards.

**Disguised Q4**
"Reading industry news" feels Q2 but is often Q4. Ask: "Did this change what I do?"

**Guilt about Q4**
Acknowledging Q4 tasks is healthy. The goal isn't perfection—it's awareness.
