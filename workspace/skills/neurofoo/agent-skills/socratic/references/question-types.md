# Socratic Question Types

## 1. Clarifying Questions

**Purpose**: Ensure you understand what's being said

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| What do you mean by X? | Terms are ambiguous |
| Can you give me an example? | Concept is abstract |
| Could you explain further? | Statement is vague |
| How does this relate to our discussion? | Relevance unclear |
| What's your main point? | Message is muddled |
| Could you say that another way? | First explanation didn't land |

**Examples**
- "When you say 'successful,' what does that look like?"
- "Can you give me a concrete example of when this happened?"
- "I want to make sure I understand—you're saying that...?"

## 2. Probing Assumptions

**Purpose**: Surface hidden beliefs and premises

| Question | What It Uncovers |
|----------|-----------------|
| What are you assuming? | Hidden premises |
| Why would you assume that? | Basis for beliefs |
| What would happen if...? | Dependency on assumption |
| Is that always the case? | Overgeneralization |
| How did you come to that belief? | Origin of assumption |

**Examples**
- "You seem to be assuming that users want more features. What makes you think that?"
- "Is it possible that isn't true in all cases?"
- "What if we didn't have that constraint?"

## 3. Probing Evidence and Reasoning

**Purpose**: Examine the basis for claims

| Question | What It Tests |
|----------|--------------|
| How do you know? | Source of knowledge |
| What evidence supports this? | Empirical basis |
| Why do you think that's true? | Reasoning chain |
| Is there any evidence against? | Counterevidence awareness |
| What would change your mind? | Falsifiability |

**Examples**
- "What data do you have that supports this?"
- "How would we test whether this is true?"
- "What would we expect to see if this were wrong?"

## 4. Questioning Viewpoints and Perspectives

**Purpose**: Consider alternative ways of seeing

| Question | What It Opens |
|----------|--------------|
| What would X think? | Different perspective |
| What's the opposite view? | Counterposition |
| Who might disagree? Why? | Opposition reasoning |
| What are we not seeing? | Blind spots |
| How would this look to an outsider? | Fresh eyes |

**Examples**
- "How would our competitors view this decision?"
- "What would someone from [different department] say about this?"
- "If we're wrong, what are we missing?"

## 5. Probing Implications and Consequences

**Purpose**: Follow logic to conclusions

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|----------------|
| What follows from that? | Logical implications |
| If that's true, what else must be true? | Necessary conditions |
| What are the consequences? | Impact analysis |
| What would that lead to? | Downstream effects |
| How does that affect X? | Specific impacts |

**Examples**
- "If we believe X, we'd also have to believe Y—do you?"
- "What are the second-order effects of this decision?"
- "If we're wrong, what's the cost?"

---

## 6. Questions About the Question

**Purpose**: Examine the inquiry itself

| Question | What It Challenges |
|----------|-------------------|
| Why is this important? | Significance |
| Is this the right question? | Framing |
| What would we do with the answer? | Actionability |
| Why are we discussing this now? | Timing/context |
| What's the real question behind this? | Underlying issue |

**Examples**
- "Before we answer—are we asking the right question?"
- "What would change if we knew the answer?"
- "Is this the symptom or the cause?"

---

## Combining Question Types

**Effective sequence:**

1. **Clarify first**: "What exactly do you mean?"
2. **Surface assumptions**: "What would have to be true for that to work?"
3. **Examine evidence**: "How do we know the assumption is valid?"
4. **Explore implications**: "If we're right, what follows?"
5. **Consider alternatives**: "What would critics say?"
6. **Step back**: "Are we asking the right question?"

## Questions to Avoid

| Avoid | Why | Better Alternative |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| "Don't you think...?" | Leading; implies answer | "What do you think about...?" |
| "Why would you...?" (accusatory) | Defensive trigger | "What led you to...?" |
| Rapid-fire questions | Overwhelming | Pause after each |
| Questions you already know the answer to | Manipulation | Ask genuine questions |
| "That's wrong, right?" | Rhetorical | "Is there another way to see this?" |
