# Socratic Questioning

Guide discovery through systematic questioning, helping examine a belief, decision, or idea more deeply.

## Instructions

Work through multiple levels of questioning to explore the topic. The goal isn't to prove the person wrong—it's to help them (or yourself) think more clearly and deeply.

### Output Format

**Topic/Belief**: [What we're examining]

---

## Starting Point

**The Claim/Position**
[Restate the belief or idea being examined]

---

## Layer 1: Clarifying the Claim

**Questions**
- What exactly do you mean by [key term]?
- Can you give a specific example of this?
- What would this look like in practice?

**Reflections**
[What these questions reveal about the claim]

---

## Layer 2: Probing Assumptions

**Hidden Assumptions**
| Assumption | Question to Test It |
|------------|-------------------|
| [assumption 1] | "Is it always true that...?" |
| [assumption 2] | "What would need to be true for...?" |

**Questions**
- What are you taking for granted here?
- Why do you think [X] leads to [Y]?
- What if [assumption] weren't true?

---

## Layer 3: Examining Evidence

**Questions**
- What evidence supports this view?
- How do you know that [claim]?
- What would change your mind?
- Is there any evidence against this?

---

## Layer 4: Exploring Implications

**Questions**
- If this is true, what else follows?
- What are the consequences of believing this?
- How does this apply to [edge case]?
- If we're wrong about this, what's the cost?

---

## Layer 5: Alternative Perspectives

**Questions**
- What would someone who disagrees say?
- How would [specific person/role] view this?
- What's the strongest argument against?

**Steel Man**
The best argument against this position:
> [Strongest counterargument]

## Synthesis

**Refined Position**
After questioning, a more nuanced view might be:
> [Refined statement]

**Remaining Questions**
- [Question 1]
