# WRAP Framework Examples

## Example 1: Career Decision

**Decision**: Should I leave my corporate job to join an early-stage startup?

---

### W: Widen Options

**Current framing**: "Stay at BigCorp or join StartupX"

**Narrow framing alert**: Yes—this is a "whether or not to leave" frame.

**Expanded options**:
1. Stay at BigCorp (original)
2. Join StartupX (original)
3. Join a Series B/C startup (lower risk, still exciting)
4. Stay but negotiate for startup-like scope
5. Take a sabbatical, try startup life before committing
6. Start my own thing part-time first
7. Join StartupX part-time as advisor while employed

**Best expansion**: Option 5 (sabbatical to test) and Option 7 (advisor first) turn an irreversible decision into a reversible experiment.

---

### R: Reality-Test

**Key assumptions**:

| Assumption | Reality Check |
|------------|---------------|
| "StartupX will succeed" | What's the base rate? ~10% of startups reach success |
| "I'll love startup life" | Have I worked at a startup before? No |
| "My BigCorp skills transfer" | Talk to startup people—do they agree? |

**Ooch**: Can I take 2 weeks vacation and work with StartupX? Spend 1 day/week as advisor for 2 months?

**Base rate**: 90% of startups fail. Even funded ones. Am I prepared for that?

**Disconfirming evidence sought**: Asked 3 former startup employees about the hard parts. Two said they returned to corporate after burnout.

---

### A: Attain Distance

**10/10/10**:
| Time | If I join startup | If I stay at BigCorp |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 10 min | Excited but scared | Relieved but disappointed |
| 10 months | Learning a lot OR stressed and uncertain | Comfortable but wondering "what if" |
| 10 years | Either succeeded wildly OR have a great story | Likely promoted but might regret not trying |

**What would I tell my best friend?**
"Try it, but test it first. Don't quit your job before you've spent real time there."

**Core priorities**: Learning, autonomy, financial security
- Startup: Higher learning/autonomy, lower security
- BigCorp: Lower learning/autonomy, higher security

---

### P: Prepare to Be Wrong

**Premortem**: "It's 18 months later and this was a disaster..."
- Startup failed, I'm job hunting
- Culture was toxic, founders were difficult
- My skills didn't transfer, I was ineffective
- I burned my BigCorp relationships by leaving abruptly

**Tripwires**:
- If I don't feel excited after 6 months, actively look at options
- If the company misses payroll once, exit immediately
- If my savings drop below 6 months expenses, reassess

**Fallback**: BigCorp industry is still hiring. I have strong references.

---

### Decision

**Choice**: Ask StartupX if I can advise part-time for 3 months while keeping my job. If that goes well and I still want to jump, then resign.

**Why**: Turns irreversible decision into reversible experiment. Tests the assumptions. Creates graceful exit path.

---

## Example 2: Product Launch

**Decision**: Should we launch this feature at our conference next month?

---

### W: Widen Options

**Current framing**: "Launch at conference or don't"

**Expanded options**:
1. Full launch at conference (original)
2. Don't launch, wait 2 more months (original)
3. Soft launch to 10% of users now, announce at conference
4. Launch beta at conference, full launch later
5. Launch at conference for new customers only
6. Partner announcement at conference, feature launch later

---

### R: Reality-Test

**Assumptions**:
| Assumption | Test |
|------------|------|
| Feature is ready | Soft launch tests this |
| Conference = good launch venue | What's historically worked for us? |
| Customers want this feature | Do we have beta feedback? |

**Ooch**: Soft launch to 50 customers this week. If no critical bugs and positive feedback, proceed.

---

### A: Attain Distance

**10/10/10**:
- 10 min: Anxious about bugs
- 10 months: Will we remember if it was conference or 2 weeks later? No.
- 10 years: Completely irrelevant

**Insight**: The timing pressure is mostly self-imposed. The feature quality matters more than the date.

---

### P: Prepare to Be Wrong

**Premortem**:
- Launch is buggy, bad PR on Twitter
- Feature isn't what customers wanted
- Conference demo fails publicly

**Tripwires**:
- If soft launch shows >1% error rate, don't announce at conference
- If NPS from beta users is <7, delay and iterate

**Fallback**: Launch as "early access" at conference, manage expectations.

---

### Decision

Soft launch immediately to 50 beta users. If metrics are green by conference, announce. If not, announce roadmap instead of launch.

---

## Example 3: Hiring Decision

**Decision**: Should we hire this candidate who's great but over budget?

---

### W: Widen Options

**Expanded options**:
1. Hire at their ask (original)
2. Don't hire (original)
3. Hire at our budget, offer equity/perks to close gap
4. Hire part-time or as contractor first
5. Hire for a different role with different budget
6. Ask them to start later when budget opens up
7. Find budget by not hiring another planned role

---

### R: Reality-Test

**Assumptions**:
| Assumption | Reality Check |
|------------|---------------|
| They're worth the premium | Check references specifically about output |
| They'll accept a lower offer | Can we ask what flexibility exists? |
| We can't find someone else | How many candidates did we see? |

---

### A: Attain Distance

**What would we tell a friend?**
"If you have to stretch your budget for every hire, something is wrong with either your budget or your sourcing."

**10/10/10**:
- 10 months: Either glad we stretched, or resenting the budget hit

---

### P: Prepare to Be Wrong

**Premortem**: They're not as productive as expected, and we're over budget

**Tripwire**: 90-day performance check. If not meeting expectations, have the conversation early.

**Fallback**: If it doesn't work, we know quickly and can course-correct.

---

### Decision

Offer at our budget cap with enhanced equity and sign-on bonus. If they decline, wish them well and continue search. Don't let one candidate create desperation.

## WRAP Quick Reference

| Villain | Counter | Key Question |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Narrow framing | **W**iden options | "What haven't we considered?" |
| Confirmation bias | **R**eality-test | "How can we test this cheaply?" |
| Short-term emotion | **A**ttain distance | "10/10/10: How will I feel?" |
| Overconfidence | **P**repare to be wrong | "If this fails, what's our tripwire and fallback?" |
