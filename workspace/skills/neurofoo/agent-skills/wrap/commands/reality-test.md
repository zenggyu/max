# Reality-Test Assumptions

Counter confirmation bias by actively seeking evidence that could prove you wrong. Test assumptions before committing.

## Instructions

Identify key assumptions underlying your decision and design ways to test them with real data, not just analysis.

### Output Format

**Decision/Belief Being Tested**: [What we're evaluating]

---

## Identify Assumptions

**What are you assuming to be true?**

| Assumption | Confidence | Importance |
|------------|------------|------------|
| [assumption 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| [assumption 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| [assumption 3] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |

---

## Consider the Opposite

For each key assumption, what would convince you it's wrong?

| Assumption | What Would Change My Mind |
|------------|--------------------------|
| [assumption] | [disconfirming evidence] |
| [assumption] | [disconfirming evidence] |

**Deliberately seek disconfirming evidence:**
Where can we look for evidence that we're wrong?

- [Source 1]
- [Source 2]

---

## Base Rates

**What's the general success rate in situations like this?**

| Situation | Base Rate | Source |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [similar situation] | [%] | [where we know this from] |

**Are we assuming we're different from the average?** [Yes/No]
If yes, what specifically makes us different?

---

## Ooch: Small Bets

**Can we test this with a small experiment before fully committing?**

| What to Test | The "Ooch" | What We'd Learn | Cost/Time |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| [assumption] | [small test] | [insight] | [cost] |
| [assumption] | [small test] | [insight] | [cost] |

**Pilot possibility**: [How to test at small scale first]

---

## Ask the Experts

**Who has direct experience with this?**

| Expert/Source | What They'd Know | How to Reach Them |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [who] | [their expertise] | [how to contact] |

**What would a skeptic say?**
> [The best argument against our current view]

---

## Evidence Summary

| Assumption | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Verdict |
|------------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| [assumption] | [supporting] | [contradicting] | [likely true/uncertain/likely false] |

---

## Revised Confidence

**Before reality-testing**: [Initial confidence %]
**After reality-testing**: [Revised confidence %]
**Key change**: [What we learned]

**Next step**: [Action to take based on findings]

## Guidelines

- Seek out disagreement, not confirmation
- "What would have to be true?" tests logic
- "What usually happens?" tests base rates
- "Can we try a small version?" tests reality
- Talk to experts who've done it, not just thought about it
