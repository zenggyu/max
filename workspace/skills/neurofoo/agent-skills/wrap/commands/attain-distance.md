## Check: Is More Distance Needed?

- [ ] I can state the decision without strong emotional charge
- [ ] I can see the other side's perspective
- [ ] I'm not deciding out of anger, fear, or desperation
- [ ] I've considered how I'll feel long-term

If unchecked items remain, consider waiting before deciding.

## Guidelines

- Strong emotions aren't always wrong—but they need examination
- "What would I tell a friend?" bypasses emotional blind spots
- 10/10/10 usually reveals short-term emotions for what they are
- Sometimes distance reveals the emotion IS the insight
- Don't decide when furious, euphoric, or desperate if you can wait
