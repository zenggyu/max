# WRAP Decision Framework

Apply the complete WRAP framework to make a better decision by countering the four villains of decision-making.

## Instructions

Work through all four phases sequentially. Each phase targets a specific cognitive bias that undermines good decisions.

### Output Format

**Decision**: [What are we deciding?]
**Context**: [Key constraints and stakes]

---

## W: WIDEN Your Options

*Counter: Narrow Framing ("Should I do X?" → "What are all my options?")*

**Current Framing**
How is the decision currently framed? (Often as "whether or not")

**Expanded Options**
| # | Option | Why It's Worth Considering |
|---|--------|---------------------------|
| 1 | [option] | [rationale] |
| 2 | [option] | [rationale] |
| 3 | [option] | [rationale] |
| 4 | [option] | [rationale] |

**Option-Finding Techniques Used**
- [ ] Vanishing options test: "If you couldn't do X, what would you do?"
- [ ] Opportunity cost: "What else could you do with this time/money?"
- [ ] Find someone who solved it: "Who's had this problem?"
- [ ] Multi-track: "What if we tried A and B simultaneously?"

## R: REALITY-TEST Your Assumptions

*Counter: Confirmation Bias (seeking evidence that confirms what we want)*

**Key Assumptions**
| Assumption | How Would We Know If Wrong? |
|------------|----------------------------|
| [assumption 1] | [test] |
| [assumption 2] | [test] |
| [assumption 3] | [test] |

**Consider the Opposite**
For each option, what would it take to be convinced it's wrong?

**Base Rates**
What usually happens in situations like this? What's the base rate of success?

**Ooch**
Is there a small experiment we can run to test this before fully committing?

| Option | Small Test | What We'd Learn |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| [option] | [test] | [insight] |

---

## A: ATTAIN Distance Before Deciding

*Counter: Short-term Emotion (deciding when angry, excited, or desperate)*

**10/10/10**
| Time Horizon | How will you feel about this decision? |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| 10 minutes | [how you feel now] |
| 10 months | [how you'll likely feel] |
| 10 years | [long-term perspective] |

**What Would I Tell My Best Friend?**
If someone you loved faced this decision, what would you tell them?

**Core Priorities**
What are your core priorities here? Does this decision align with them?

| Priority | How Each Option Aligns |
|----------|----------------------|
| [priority 1] | [alignment] |
| [priority 2] | [alignment] |

---

## P: PREPARE to Be Wrong

*Counter: Overconfidence ("I'm sure this will work")*

**Premortem**
Imagine this decision failed completely. What went wrong?

| Failure Mode | How to Prevent/Detect |
|--------------|----------------------|
| [what could fail] | [safeguard] |
| [what could fail] | [safeguard] |

**Tripwires**
Set a future point to reconsider:

| Tripwire | Action If Triggered |
|----------|-------------------|
| [date or condition] | [what we'll do] |
| [metric threshold] | [what we'll do] |

**Bookend the Future**
| Scenario | What Would You Do? |
|----------|-------------------|
| Best case | [response] |
| Worst case | [response] |

## Decision

**Recommendation**
Based on the WRAP analysis:
> [Your decision and reasoning]

**Key Safeguards**
- [Safeguard 1]
- [Safeguard 2]

**Review Date**: [When to reassess]

## Guidelines

- Don't skip phases—each counters a different bias
- "Should I?" is almost always narrow framing
- Look for the third option beyond the obvious two
- Ooch when you can—small tests beat big analysis
- Set tripwires before you need them
