# Widen Your Options

Generate more options to escape narrow framing. Counter the tendency to see decisions as "whether or not" instead of "which of many."

## Instructions

Take the current decision framing and expand it to include more options. Use specific techniques to discover overlooked alternatives.

### Output Format

**Current Decision**: [How it's currently framed]

---

## Narrow Framing Check

**Is this a "whether or not" decision?**
[Yes/No] — If yes, that's a sign of narrow framing.

**The two obvious options:**
1. [Option that seems obvious]
2. [The other obvious option]

## Option Expansion Techniques

### Vanishing Options Test
"If both current options disappeared, what would you do?"

- [New option 1]
- [New option 2]

### Opportunity Cost
"What else could you do with the same time, money, or effort?"

- [Alternative use 1]
- [Alternative use 2]

### Find Someone Who Solved It
"Who has faced this problem before? What did they do?"

| Person/Company | Their Solution | Applicable? |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| [who] | [what they did] | [yes/no/partial] |

### Multi-Tracking
"Can we do multiple options simultaneously instead of choosing one?"

- [Combined approach 1]
- [Combined approach 2]

### AND vs OR
"Instead of A OR B, is there a way to get A AND B?"

[Possibility for having both]

### The "Opposite" Option
"What if we did the exact opposite of what we're considering?"

[Opposite approach and what we can learn from it]

## Reframed Decision

**Old frame**: "Should we do X or Y?"

**New frame**: "Given we want [outcome], which of these [N] paths best achieves it?"

## Guidelines

- "Whether or not" is almost always too narrow
- Great decisions come from great options
- You can't choose a better option if you haven't imagined it
- Look for the option you're afraid to consider
