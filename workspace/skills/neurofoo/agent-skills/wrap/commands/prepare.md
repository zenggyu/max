# Prepare to Be Wrong

Counter overconfidence by planning for both success and failure. Set tripwires and fallbacks before you need them.

## Instructions

Assume you might be wrong. Plan for how you'll detect problems and what you'll do. This isn't pessimism—it's preparedness.

### Output Format

**Decision/Plan**: [What you've decided to do]

---

## Premortem

*Imagine this decision failed completely. What happened?*

**It's 6 months later. This was a disaster. Looking back, what went wrong?**

| Failure Mode | Likelihood | Severity | Was It Predictable? |
|--------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| [what failed] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Yes/No] |
| [what failed] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Yes/No] |
| [what failed] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Yes/No] |

**Which failures can we prevent now?**

| Failure | Prevention |
|---------|-----------|
| [failure] | [how to prevent it] |
| [failure] | [how to prevent it] |

## Bookend the Future

**Best realistic case:**
> If everything goes well, what does success look like?
[Description]

**Worst realistic case:**
> If things go badly, what does failure look like?
[Description]

**Are we prepared for the worst case?** [Yes/No/Partially]

**What would make the worst case more survivable?**
- [Mitigation 1]
- [Mitigation 2]

## Set Tripwires

*Decide in advance what would cause you to reconsider*

| Tripwire | Trigger Condition | Action If Triggered |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Date | [specific date to review] | [reassess decision] |
| Metric | [if X drops below Y] | [specific action] |
| Event | [if specific thing happens] | [specific action] |
| Resource | [if we spend more than X] | [stop and evaluate] |

**Tripwire reminder set?** [Where/how will you be reminded?]

---

## Safety Net

**If we're wrong, what's our fallback?**

| If This Happens | Our Response |
|-----------------|--------------|
| [scenario 1] | [fallback plan] |
| [scenario 2] | [fallback plan] |

**Reversibility Assessment**

| Aspect of Decision | Reversible? | Cost to Reverse |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| [aspect] | Yes/No/Partially | [cost] |

**Is there a way to make this decision more reversible?**
[Possibility]

---

## Confidence Calibration

**How confident are you this will work?** [___]%

**Base rate: In situations like this, what's the typical success rate?** [___]%

**Is your confidence higher than the base rate? Why?**
[Justification or recalibration]

---

## Commitment Plan

**We're committing to this decision, while also:**

1. **Watching for**: [early warning signs]
2. **Revisiting on**: [specific date]
3. **Stopping if**: [tripwire condition]
4. **Pivoting to**: [fallback option] if needed

**Decision with safeguards:**
> [State the decision along with key safeguards]

## Guidelines

- Confidence feels good but isn't correlated with accuracy
- "We'll figure it out" isn't a plan—specify the fallback
- Tripwires work because they're set before emotions cloud judgment
- Reversible decisions need less preparation than irreversible ones
- The goal isn't to be pessimistic—it's to be prepared
