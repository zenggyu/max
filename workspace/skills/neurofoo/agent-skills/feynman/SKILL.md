# Feynman Technique

Apply the full Feynman learning technique to deeply understand a concept.

## Instructions

Work through all four steps of the Feynman technique. Be honest about gaps—they're the point.

### Output Format

**Concept**: [What are we trying to understand?]

---

## Step 1: Explain It Simply

*Explain as if teaching someone with no background in this field*

### Simple Explanation

[Write a plain-language explanation. Use everyday words. Avoid jargon. Aim for a bright 12-year-old to understand.]

### Analogy

[Create an analogy using something familiar to illustrate the concept]

---

## Step 2: Identify Gaps

*Where did the explanation get fuzzy, hand-wavy, or require jargon?*

### Gaps Found

| Gap | What I Said | What I'm Not Sure About |
|-----|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | [vague part] | [the underlying question] |
| 2 | [vague part] | [the underlying question] |
| 3 | [vague part] | [the underlying question] |

### Jargon Used

| Term | Can I Explain It Simply? |
|------|-------------------------|
| [term] | Yes / No / Partially |

---

## Step 3: Fill the Gaps

*Research or think through each gap*

### Gap 1: [Topic]
- **The question**: [What wasn't clear?]
- **The answer**: [What I learned]
- **Now I can explain it as**: [Simple version]

---

## Step 4: Refined Explanation

*Rewrite the complete explanation with gaps filled and simpler language*

### Final Simple Explanation

[The improved, complete explanation in plain language]

### Improved Analogy

[A refined or new analogy that better captures the concept]

### Key Takeaways

1. [Core insight 1]
2. [Core insight 2]
3. [Core insight 3]

**Test Question**
If someone asked me to explain this in 30 seconds, I'd say:
> [Elevator pitch version]

## Guidelines

- Don't pretend to understand—gaps are valuable
- Use analogies from everyday life
- If you need jargon, define it simply
- Shorter is usually better
- The "explain to a child" bar is high—take it seriously
