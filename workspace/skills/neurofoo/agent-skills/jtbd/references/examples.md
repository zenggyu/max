# Jobs to Be Done Examples

## Example 1: Why People Hire Milkshakes

The classic JTBD example from Clayton Christensen.

**Context**: A fast-food chain wanted to sell more milkshakes.

### Traditional Approach (Failed)
- Surveyed customers about milkshake preferences
- Made them thicker, sweeter, more flavors
- Sales didn't budge

### JTBD Approach
Observed *when* people bought milkshakes:
- 40% sold before 8am
- Buyers were alone, in cars, buying only a milkshake

**Job Statement**
> When I have a long, boring commute, I want something to make the drive more interesting and keep me full until lunch, so I can feel engaged and not arrive at work hungry.

### Job Dimensions

**Functional**
- Last the whole commute (20+ minutes)
- One-handed consumption while driving
- Filling enough to skip breakfast

**Emotional**
- Break up the boredom
- Indulgent start to the day

**Competitive Alternatives**
| Alternative | Why It Gets Fired |
|-------------|------------------|
| Bagel | Crumbs everywhere, gone too fast |
| Banana | Done in 30 seconds |
| Donut | Messy, not filling |
| Candy bar | Guilt |
| Coffee | Too hot, needs attention |

### Insight
The milkshake's competitors weren't other milkshakes—they were bagels and boredom.

**Product implications**: Make it thicker (lasts longer), add fruit chunks (engagement), larger straw (interesting texture), faster purchase.

## Example 2: Budgeting Apps

**Subject**: Why people download budgeting apps (and then abandon them)

### The Context

**When does the job arise?**
- After a "wake-up call" (overdraft, credit card statement shock, life transition)
- Beginning of month, year, or financial goal

**Who has this job?**
- People who feel out of control financially
- Not the naturally frugal (they already have systems)

### Job Statement

> When I realize I don't know where my money goes, I want to feel in control of my finances, so I can stop the anxiety and make progress toward goals.

### Job Dimensions

**Functional**
| Job | Importance | Current Solution |
|-----|------------|-----------------|
| Track spending | High | Check bank app manually |
| Categorize expenses | Medium | Mental math or nothing |
| Set and track budgets | High | Spreadsheets, paper |

**Emotional**
| Want to Feel | Want to Avoid |
|--------------|---------------|
| In control | Anxious about money |
| Responsible | Guilty about spending |
| Optimistic about future | Ashamed of past choices |

**Social**
| Perception | Audience |
|------------|----------|
| Financially responsible | Partner, family |
| Not struggling | Friends |
| Adult with life together | Self |

### Why People "Fire" Budgeting Apps

| Deal Breaker | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| Too much manual entry | Feels like work; already stressed |
| Shows painful truths | Emotional avoidance |
| No visible progress | Doesn't deliver the "in control" feeling |
| Bank sync fails | Broken trust, effort wasted |

### Forces Analysis

**Pushing toward change**
- Overdraft fee (immediate pain)
- Partner's complaints about spending
- Life goal requiring savings (wedding, house)

**Resisting change**
- "I know I should but..." (inertia)
- Fear of what the data will show
- Past failures with budgeting

### Insight

**The real job isn't tracking spending—it's feeling in control.**

Apps that just show data often fail because data → anxiety, not data → control.

**Winners**: Apps that celebrate progress, automate savings (action), show improvement over time.

## Example 3: Slack vs Email

**Subject**: Why teams adopt Slack

### Job Statement

> When I need to communicate quickly with colleagues, I want messages to feel like conversation, not formal letters, so I can collaborate fluidly without switching contexts.

### Functional Jobs

| Job | Email | Slack |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Quick questions | Slow, formal | Fast, casual |
| Group decisions | Reply-all chaos | Channel threading |
| Share files | Attachments | Inline preview |
| Search history | Buried in inbox | Searchable channels |

### Emotional Jobs

| Feeling | Email Delivers? | Slack Delivers? |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Connected to team | No (isolated) | Yes (presence, reactions) |
| Responsive | Stressful | Normal |
| Part of conversation | No (broadcast) | Yes (threads) |

### Why Email Gets "Fired" for Quick Collaboration

- Email's formality creates friction ("Hi John, Hope you're well...")
- Response time expectations mismatch
- No sense of who's available
- Threading is broken

### Why Slack Sometimes Gets "Fired"

- Notification overload
- FOMO from missing messages
- Interruption culture
- Everything feels urgent

### Competitive Insight

Slack's real competitor isn't email—it's:
- Walking over to someone's desk
- Text message to colleague
- Waiting for the next meeting

### Product Implications

- Status indicators (solve "is anyone there?")
- Casual reactions (replace "Thanks!")
- Channel organization (solve noise)

## Example 4: Standing Desks

**Subject**: Why knowledge workers buy standing desks

### Job Statement

> When I spend all day at a desk and feel physically stiff, I want to feel like I'm taking care of my health, so I can reduce guilt about my sedentary job and feel more energetic.

### The Telling Observation

Most standing desk owners **don't stand that much**. They stand for short periods, then sit.

### Real Jobs

**Functional**
| Job | Importance |
|-----|------------|
| Actually stand and work | Low (rarely done) |
| Ability to change positions | High |
| Not feel trapped | High |

**Emotional**
| Want to Feel | Evidence |
|--------------|----------|
| Healthy despite desk job | "At least I have the option" |
| Like someone who cares about health | Social signaling |
| Energy, not sluggish | Position changes help |

**Social**
| Perception | Audience |
|------------|----------|
| Health-conscious | Coworkers |
| Not the stereotypical desk worker | Self |

### Compensating Behaviors Before Standing Desks

| Workaround | What It Reveals |
|------------|-----------------|
| Taking walks | Need to move, not specifically stand |
| Stretching at desk | Position variety is the need |
| Feeling guilty | Emotional job is primary |

### Insight

**The job isn't "stand while working"—it's "feel less guilty about sitting and have the option to move."**

**Product implications**:
- Easy transitions matter more than standing time
- Sell the feeling of health choice, not ergonomics
- Movement > static standing

## Example 5: Premium Coffee Shops

**Subject**: Why people pay $6 for coffee they could make for $0.50

### Job Statement

> When I need a break from work/home, I want a third place that's productive but not work, so I can reset mentally and feel like I'm treating myself.

### The Real Jobs

**Functional**
| Job | Home Coffee Fails | Starbucks Delivers |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| Get caffeine | ✓ | ✓ |
| Brief escape | ✗ | ✓ |
| Change of scenery | ✗ | ✓ |
| Productive environment | Maybe | ✓ (for some) |

**Emotional**
- Small indulgence
- Break from routine
- Moment of calm in busy day
- Treat that's not "bad" (vs. candy)

**Social**
- Fitting in (everyone has a cup)
- Creative/professional signaling (laptop + latte)
- Meeting spot that's not home or office

### Competitive Alternatives

| Alternative | When Hired | Weakness |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Making coffee at home | Morning routine | No escape |
| Office coffee | In the flow | No break |
| Taking a walk | Need movement | No "treat" |
| Bar | After work | Too social, alcohol |

### Insight

**People aren't buying coffee. They're buying:**
- A socially acceptable break
- A small luxury
- A "third place"

**Product implications**: Environment matters more than beverage quality for this job. Comfortable seating, wifi, and ambiance > better beans.

## JTBD Interview Questions

**Finding the job:**
- "Tell me about the last time you bought/used X..."
- "What was going on in your life when you decided to..."
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"

**Understanding switching:**
- "What were you using before?"
- "What pushed you to look for something new?"
- "What almost stopped you from switching?"

**Emotional and social dimensions:**
- "How did you feel about your old solution?"
- "What would your [colleague/friend/partner] think?"
- "What would success look like?"

## Common JTBD Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Defining jobs too narrowly**
> "Job: Send email"

Better: "Communicate with colleague without scheduling a meeting"

**Mistake 2: Ignoring emotional jobs**
> "People just want X to be faster"

Usually: "People want to *feel* efficient/in control/not frustrated"

**Mistake 3: Focusing on product features**
> "They hire us because we have feature X"

Better: "They hire us to make progress on [job], and feature X is one way we help"

**Mistake 4: Forgetting "do nothing" is a competitor**
Sometimes the struggle isn't worth solving. People live with problems.
