## Principle Reference

1. **Place yourself in the background** — Write to serve the reader, not to show off. Style emerges from content, not from the writer's ego.

2. **Write naturally** — Don't consciously imitate others or force an affected style. Write as you would speak to an intelligent friend.

3. **Work from suitable design** — Plan your piece. Know your scope and structure before writing extensively.

4. **Write with nouns and verbs** — These give writing strength. Adjectives and adverbs are not your principal weapons.

5. **Revise and rewrite** — Good writing is rewriting. Don't expect first drafts to be final.

6. **Don't overwrite** — Avoid ornate, flowery prose. Rich prose is hard to digest.

7. **Don't overstate** — Avoid superlatives and exaggeration. A single overstatement can undermine your credibility.

8. **Avoid qualifiers** — Words like "very," "rather," "quite," "pretty," and "little" weaken prose.

9. **Don't affect breeziness** — Forced casualness and flip remarks suggest the writer values cleverness over substance.

10. **Use orthodox spelling** — Follow standard conventions unless you have good reason not to.

11. **Don't explain too much** — Trust the reader. Avoid excessive adverbs after "said" and over-explanatory dialogue tags.

12. **Don't construct awkward adverbs** — Avoid forcing "-ly" onto words that don't take it naturally.

13. **Make sure speakers are clear** — In dialogue, readers must always know who is speaking.

14. **Avoid fancy words** — Prefer the plain word to the fancy one. "Home" not "domicile."

15. **Use dialect sparingly** — The best dialect writers use minimal deviation from standard language.

16. **Be clear** — Clarity is the foundation. Muddiness is not depth; obscurity is not profundity.

17. **Don't inject opinion** — Keep personal opinions out unless they serve the work. They mark the egoist.

18. **Use figures of speech sparingly** — Metaphors and similes need space. Constant comparison exhausts the reader.

19. **Don't sacrifice clarity for shortcuts** — Strong, precise words are better than clever abbreviations.

20. **Avoid foreign languages** — Write in English. Foreign phrases can seem pretentious.

21. **Prefer standard to offbeat** — Choose established words over trendy or invented ones.

## Guidelines

- Focus on patterns, not isolated instances
- Some rules can be broken intentionally for effect—note when this seems intentional
- "Needs Work" means a pattern of violations, not a single instance
- Technical or specialized writing may legitimately use jargon
- Creative writing may intentionally break rules for voice
