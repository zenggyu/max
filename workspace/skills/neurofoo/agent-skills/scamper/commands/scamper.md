# SCAMPER Creative Exploration

Apply all seven SCAMPER prompts to systematically explore creative possibilities for a product, service, process, or problem.

## Instructions

Work through each of the seven prompts, generating multiple ideas for each. Quantity matters—don't self-edit too early. Wild ideas often lead to practical innovations.

### Output Format

**Subject**: [What we're SCAMPERing]
**Goal**: [What we're trying to achieve]

## S: SUBSTITUTE
*What can be replaced with something else?*

| Component | Substitute With | New Possibility |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [element] | [replacement] | [what it enables] |
| [element] | [replacement] | [what it enables] |
| [element] | [replacement] | [what it enables] |

**Questions to explore:**
- What materials could be substituted?
- What other ingredients or components?
- What other process could be used?
- What if we substituted the place, time, or person?

## C: COMBINE
*What can be merged, blended, or bundled together?*

| Combine This | With This | Result |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| [element A] | [element B] | [new thing] |
| [element A] | [element B] | [new thing] |
| [element A] | [element B] | [new thing] |

**Questions to explore:**
- What ideas, features, or components can be combined?
- What if we combined purposes or objectives?
- What if we merged with another product/service?
- What talents or resources could be combined?

## A: ADAPT
*What can be copied, borrowed, or modified from elsewhere?*

| Source | Idea to Adapt | How to Apply |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| [where it's from] | [the concept] | [application here] |
| [where it's from] | [the concept] | [application here] |
| [where it's from] | [the concept] | [application here] |

**Questions to explore:**
- What else is like this? What could I copy?
- What ideas from other industries apply?
- What from the past could be adapted?
- What could we emulate?

## M: MODIFY / MAGNIFY / MINIMIZE
*What can be changed, enlarged, or reduced?*

### Modify
| Element | Modification | Effect |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| [element] | [change] | [result] |

### Magnify
| Element | Make Bigger/More | Effect |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| [element] | [amplification] | [result] |

### Minimize
| Element | Make Smaller/Less | Effect |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| [element] | [reduction] | [result] |

**Questions to explore:**
- What if we made it bigger, stronger, faster?
- What if we exaggerated it?
- What if we made it smaller, lighter, slower?
- What can be streamlined?

## P: PUT TO OTHER USES
*What else could this be used for?*

| Current Use | New Use | New Market/Context |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| [how it's used now] | [different use] | [who would want it] |
| [how it's used now] | [different use] | [who would want it] |
| [how it's used now] | [different use] | [who would want it] |

**Questions to explore:**
- Who else could use this?
- In what other contexts would this work?
- What if it were used by a different market?
- What waste products have value?

## E: ELIMINATE
*What can be removed, omitted, or simplified?*

| Element to Remove | Why We Think We Need It | What If Gone? |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| [element] | [assumed reason] | [possibility] |
| [element] | [assumed reason] | [possibility] |
| [element] | [assumed reason] | [possibility] |

**Questions to explore:**
- What's not really necessary?
- What if we removed a rule or constraint?
- What would happen with less?
- What can be simplified, streamlined?

---

## R: REVERSE / REARRANGE
*What can be flipped, reordered, or turned inside out?*

| Current State | Reversed/Rearranged | Possibility |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| [how it is now] | [flipped version] | [what opens up] |
| [how it is now] | [flipped version] | [what opens up] |
| [how it is now] | [flipped version] | [what opens up] |

**Questions to explore:**
- What if we did it in reverse order?
- What if we swapped roles?
- What if we turned it inside out or upside down?
- What if we did the opposite?

## Idea Harvest

**Top Ideas Generated**

| Idea | From (S/C/A/M/P/E/R) | Feasibility | Impact |
|------|---------------------|-------------|--------|
| [best idea] | [letter] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| [second idea] | [letter] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| [third idea] | [letter] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |

**Wild Card**
The craziest idea that might actually work:
> [Idea]

**Next Step**
[What to do with these ideas]

## Guidelines

- Quantity over quality during generation
- No idea is too wild—judge later
- Each prompt can generate multiple ideas
- Combining ideas from different letters often yields best results
- "We can't do that" should be followed by "...unless?"
