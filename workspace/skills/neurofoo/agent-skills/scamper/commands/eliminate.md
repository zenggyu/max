# ELIMINATE

Generate ideas by asking what can be removed, omitted, simplified, or streamlined.

## Instructions

Challenge assumptions about what's necessary. Consider what could be removed without losing core value—and what new value might emerge from subtraction.

### Output Format

## Radical Elimination

**What if we removed 50%?**
[Describe the minimalist version]
