- [ ] What should I call my human?

### Notes
- Asked to delete documents I "previously created" — but I have no memory of them yet. Need clarification.
- **Language preference:** User prefers Chinese (中文) for communication

### Working with Nick - Lessons Learned

**2026-02-10: Feishu Document Permissions**
- **Lesson:** Feishu apps cannot delete documents they create (ownership issue)
- **Solution pattern:** User creates document → shares link → I write content
- **Why this works:** User remains owner, has full control (delete, transfer permissions)
- **Limitation:** Cannot specify owner during API creation - must be done manually by user first

**Project Started: IoT Customer Insight System**
- **Type:** Requirements specification document
- **Scope:** Comprehensive system for telecom operators (customer profiling, analytics, workflow)
- **My role:** Collaborate with Nick to refine and expand requirements
- **Working style:** Nick provides framework → I help detail specific modules

### Work Preferences (From Observations)
- Prefers direct, efficient communication
- Values learning and continuous improvement
- Expects me to proactively summarize and learn from interactions
- **File Management:** Keep workspace clean and organized, avoid clutter, reflect on file organization during weekly reviews
- **File Sharing via Feishu:** When asked to send a file, always use the file attachment API (filePath parameter) instead of sending file content as a message

### File Management Guidelines (Set by Nick)
- ✅ Create files in proper locations (project folders)
- ✅ Keep workspace root clean
- ✅ Reflect on file organization during weekly reviews
- ✅ Continuously improve file/folder structure
